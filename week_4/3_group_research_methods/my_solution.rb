# Identify and describe the ruby method you implemented. 
# .map is the Ruby method I implemented. It returns a new array with the results of running the block once for every element in enumerator.
# This is different from array.each, which returns the original array. 
# I also used .is_a?(Integer) to specify whether an element or value is an integer.

Reflect!

I learned a lot in this lesson. My driver code initially wasn't passing. When I deleted the driver test code, my code did what I wanted it to, but when I 
added the driver test code, it printed two versions of each array and hash and registered as "false". Attending a tutoring session with Dominic, I 
learned that this was because I had "print source" in my method when I should have just printed the method call (which would have returned the 
mapped source) and driver test code. Also, I learned that having a bang after source.map was contributing to two different copies of the data
structure being printed in this case.

I also learned that there is a difference between p, print, and puts. Puts and print call to_s on an object (with puts adding a newline).  
p calls the inspect method, making it better for debugging since you see your code in the data type its written in.ï»¿

Dominic also taught me how to use subl from terminal to make it easier to open files.

I asked Dominic whether code should be adapted to fit a test or a test should be adapted to fit a code that seems to be working but isn't passing,
and he told me that code should be adapted to fit a test. This was important to understand early on.

In addition, I learned about some new methods (in particular, map and is_a) and became better acquainted with the Ruby specification. I learned that
Enumerable methods apply to both arrays and hashes.
